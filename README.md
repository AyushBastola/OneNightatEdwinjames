# One Night at Edwinjames' #
On one fateful day, your friend Edwinjames invites you over to his house.
You arrive there and the both of you spend the day playing video games.
Eventually, the both of you grow tired as the time comes closer to midnight.
You both eventually pass out.
When midnight is struck, however; you're mysteriously awoken to find Edwinjames missing.
You get up and search for him, and there you find what once was your friend turned into a deadly animatronic.
You will now have to survive against Edwinjames, using whatever is provided to you. Good luck.
